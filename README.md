# Computer Graphics Mini Project 1
# Artistic 3D Sphere Project

This project expands upon a baseline 3D sphere visualization by enhancing its artistic appeal and creating a visually striking piece in Python. The project uses the `pycairo` library for rendering graphics and involves creative and complex design to produce an aesthetic output, suitable for artistic and practical demonstrations.

## Features

- **3D Sphere Visualization**: Starts with a simple 3D sphere.
- **Dynamic Artistic Transformation**: Enhances the basic sphere into an interactive and visually appealing creation.
- **Realistic Rendering**: Utilizes PyCairo's graphics capabilities to create high-quality visuals.
